To run:
1. Run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' in the directory
2. Replace the "your key here" strings with your API keys for the OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google APIs.
3. Open project.ipynb and run the cells to initialize all helper functions, then run the cell calling main().
4. To quickly test with a pre-defined prompt, use the cell calling runAll() and modify the passed-in prompt and model choice to your liking.
